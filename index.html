    As part of team HZW for this year’s competition, I’ve been getting stuck into building the hardware of our robot, taking a more challenging path than I would’ve liked to (so far, it’s a two-person team of I and me!). The first competition event was on a Saturday in Horsham, so I panicked and thanks to our fabulous DT department, threw this frame and wheels together the day before we needed it. Turns out, the other teams at the “Tech Day” were more or less at a planning stage, so we were way ahead of the competition.
